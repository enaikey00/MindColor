# MindColor ðŸ§ ðŸŒŠ
MindColor is a simple GAN that takes brain waves as input, and attempts to recreate the image that the person was looking at while its mind was being recorded.
This is my final project for class "Machine Learning Advanced Models".

## Dataset

Brainwaves
- brainwaves were collected using a meditation headband, made by Flowtime [link](https://www.meetflowtime.com/);
- 5 different types of waves: alpha, betha, gamma, delta, theta

Images
- images were generated with python and matplotlib;
- four categories of images: red, blue, green, yellow as squares.
  
In detail I have recorded my brain activity while staring at each image, for about 15 minutes. 
Data is collected by the headband every 0.6 seconds.
